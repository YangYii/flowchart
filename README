# Flowchart

A very simple command line utility that tells you what to do next.

Usage

     flowchart git-undo

The above command will help you figure out how to undo a change in Git, 
based on [@emmajanehw's diagram](https://twitter.com/emmajanehw/status/549919920990208000).

In fact, that diagram is the original raison d'Ãªtre for this app. More
options coming soon!
